[For an explainer of an explainer, see the [TAG explainer template](https://github.com/w3ctag/w3ctag.github.io/blob/master/explainers.md). A good concrete example is the [WebXR Device API Explained](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/blob/master/explainer.md) document]

# Web Neural Network API Explained

## What’s all this then?

A brief, 4-5 paragraph explanation of the feature’s value. Outline what the feature does and how it accomplishes those goals (in prose). If your feature creates UI, this is a great place to show mocks and user flows.

### Goals

How will the web be better when this feature launches? And who will it help?

### Non-goals

You’re not going to solve every problem so enumerate the attractive, nearby problems that are out of scope for this effort. This may include details on the tradeoffs made due to architectural limitations made due to implementation details, and features left out either due to interoperability concerns or other hurdles, and how you plan to improve on this. This can often be the single most important part of your document, so give it careful thought.

## Getting started / example code

Provide a terse example for the most common use case of the feature.  If you need to show how to get the feature set up (initialized, or using permissions, etc.), include that too

## Key scenarios

Next, discuss the key scenarios which move beyond the most canonical example, showing how they are addressed using example code:

### Scenario 1

Outline the scenario, then provide:

[sample code that demonstrates the feature]

### Scenario 2

Outline the scenario, then provide:

[sample code that demonstrates the feature]

## Detailed design discussion

### Tricky design choice #1

Talk through the tradeoffs in coming to the specific design point you want to make, hopefully:

### Tricky design choice N

## Considered alternatives
One of the most important things you can do in your design process is to catalog the set of roads not taken. As you iterate on your design, you may find that major choices in your approach or API style will be revisited and enumerating the full space of alternatives can help you apply one (or more) of them later, may serve as a “graveyard” for u-turns in your design, and can give reviewers and potential users confidence that you’ve got your ducks in a row.

## References & acknowledgements

Your design will change and be informed by many people; acknowledge them in an ongoing way! It helps build community and, as we only get by through the contributions of many, is only fair.
