Introduction {#intro}
=====================

We're working on this section. Meanwhile, please take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/blob/master/explainer.md">explainer</a>.

Use cases {#usecases}
=====================

## Application Use Cases ## {#usecases-application}

This section illustrates application-level use cases for neural network
inference hardware acceleration. All applications in those use cases can be
built on top of pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) [[models]].

### Person Detection ### {#usecase-person-detection}

A user opens a web-based video conferencing application, but she temporarily
leaves from her room. The application is watching whether she is in front of her
PC by using object detection (for example, using object detection approaches
such as [[SSD]] or [[YOLO]] that use a single DNN) to detect regions in a camera
input frame that include persons.

When she comes back, the application automatically detects her and notifies
other online users that she is active now.

### Semantic Segmentation ### {#usecase-segmentation}

A user joins a teleconference via a web-based video conferencing application at
her desk since no meeting room in her office is available. During the
teleconference, she does not wish that her room and people in the background are
visible. To protect the privacy of the other people and the surroundings, the
application runs a machine learning model such as [[DeepLabv3+]] or
[[MaskR-CNN]] to semantically split an image into segments and replaces
segments that represent other people and background with another picture.

### Skeleton Detection ### {#usecase-skeleton-detection}

A web-based video conferencing application tracks a pose of user's skeleton by
running a machine learning model, which allows for real-time human pose
estimation, such as [[PoseNet]] to recognize her gesture and body language. When
she raises her hand, her microphone is automatically unmuted and she can start
speaking on the teleconference.

### Face Recognition ### {#usecase-face-recognition}

There are multiple people in the conference room and they join an online meeting
using a web-based video conferencing application. The application detects faces
of participants by using object detection (for example, using object detection
approaches such as [[SSD]]) and checks whether each face was present at the
previous meeting or not by running a machine learning model such as [[FaceNet]],
which verifies whether two faces would be identical or not.

### Facial Landmark Detection ### {#usecase-facial-landmarks}

A user wants to find new glasses that beautifully fits her on an online glasses
store. The online store offers web-based try-on simulator that runs a machine
learning model such as Face Alignment Network [[FAN]] to detect facial landmarks
like eyes, nose, mouth, etc. When she chooses a pair of glasses, the simulator
properly renders the selected glasses on the detected position of eyes on her
facial image.

### Style Transfer ### {#usecase-style-transfer}

A user is looking for cosmetics on an online store and wondering which color may
fit her face. The online store shows sample facial makeup images of cosmetics,
and offers makeup simulator that runs a machine learning model like
[[ContextualLoss]] or [[PairedCycleGAN]] to transfer the makeup style of the
sample makeup image to her facial image. She can check how the selected makeup
looks like on her face by the simulator.

### Super Resolution ### {#usecase-super-resolution}

A web-based video conferencing is receiving a video stream from its peer, but
the resolution of the video becomes lower due to network congestion. To prevent
degradation of the perceived video quality, the application runs a machine
learning model for super-resolution such as [[SRGAN]] to generate
higher-resolution video frames.

### Image Captioning ### {#usecase-image-captioning}

For better accessibility, a web-based presentation application provides
automatic image captioning by running a machine learning model such as
[[im2txt]] which predicts explanatory words of the presentation slides.

### Machine Translation ### {#usecase-translation}

Multiple people from various countries are talking via a web-based real-time
text chat application. The application translates their conversation by using a
machine learning model such as [[GNMT]] or [[OpenNMT]], which translates every
text into different language.

### Emotion Analysis ### {#usecase-emotion-analysis}

A user is talking to her friend via a web-based real-time text chat application,
and she is wondering how the friend feels because she cannot see the friend's
face. The application analyses the friend's emotion by using a machine learning
model such as [[DeepMoji]], which infers emotion from input texts, and displays
an emoji that represents the estimated emotion.

### Video Summarization ### {#usecase-video-summalization}

A web-based video conferencing application records received video streams, and
it needs to reduce recorded video data to be stored. The application generates
the short version of the recorded video by using a machine learning model for
video summarization such as [[Video-Summarization-with-LSTM]].

### Noise Suppression ### {#usecase-noise-suppression}

A web-based video conferencing application records received audio streams, but 
usually the background noise is everywhere. The application leverages real-time 
noise suppression using Recurrent Neural Network such as [[RNNoise]] for 
suppressing background dynamic noise like baby cry or dog barking to improve 
audio experiences in video conferences.

## Framework Use Cases ## {#usecases-framework}

This section collects framework-level use cases for a dedicated low-level API
for neural network inference hardware acceleration. It is expected that Machine
Learning frameworks will be key consumers of the Web Neural Network API (WebNN
API) and the low-level details exposed through the WebNN API are abstracted out
from typical web developers. However, it is also expected that web developers
with specific interest and competence in Machine Learning will want to interface
with the WebNN API directly instead of a higher-level ML framework.

### Custom Layer ### {#usecase-custom-layer}

A web application developer wants to run a DNN model on the WebNN API. However,
she has found that some of activation functions like [[LeakyReLU]], [[ELU]],
etc. are not included in the WebNN API. To address this issue, she constructs
custom layers of the additional activation functions on top of the WebNN API.
Note that the scope of custom layers may include convolution, normalization,
etc. as well as activation.

### Network Concatenation ### {#usecase-network-concat}

A web application uses a DNN model, and its model data of upper convolutional
layers and lower fully-connected layers are stored in separate files, since
model data of the fully-connected layers are periodically updated due to fine
tuning at the server side.

Therefore, the application downloads both partial model files at first and
concatenates them into a single model. When the model is updated, the
application downloads fine-tuned part of the model and replace only the
fully-connected layers with it.

### Performance Adaptation ### {#usecase-perf-adapt}

A web application developer has a concern about performance of her DNN model on
mobile devices. She has confirmed that it may run too slow on mobile devices
which do not have GPU acceleration. To address this issue, her web application
refers to the WebNN API to confirm whether acceleration is available or not, so
that the application can display the warning for devices without acceleration.

After several weeks, she has developed a tiny DNN model that can even run on
CPU. In order to accommodate CPU execution, she modifies the application
so that the application loads the tiny model in the case of CPU-only devices.

### Operation Level Execution ### {#usecase-op-level-exec}

A JavaScript ML framework is responsible for loading, interpreting and executing a ML model. During the model execution phase, the framework iterates through the operations of the model and executes each operation on the hardware device, like CPU, GPU or ML accelerator. To avoid the unnecessary data copying across devices, the framework selects the same device to execute the operations. For a compute intensive operation, such as convolution 2D or matrix multiplication, the framework uses WebNN API to execute it with the ML-specific acceleration available on that selected device.

# Programming Model # {#programming-model}
## Timelines ## {#programming-model-timelines}

*This section is non-normative.*

A computer system with a user agent at the front-end and ML device at the back-end
has components working on different timelines in parallel:

: <dfn dfn>Content timeline</dfn>
:: Associated with the execution of the Web script.
    It includes calling all methods described by this specification.

    <div class=content-timeline>
        Steps executed on the content timeline look like this.
    </div>

: <dfn dfn>Device timeline</dfn>
:: Associated with the ML device operations
    that are issued by the user agent.
    It includes creation of ML devices and resources
    and state objects, which are typically synchronous operations from the point
    of view of the user agent part that controls the ML device,
    but can live in a separate OS process.

    <div class=device-timeline>
        Steps executed on the device timeline look like this.
    </div>

: <dfn dfn>Queue timeline</dfn>
:: Associated with the execution of operations on the compute units of the ML device.
    It includes actual copy and compute jobs that run on the ML device.

    <div class=queue-timeline>
        Steps executed on the queue timeline look like this.
    </div>

In this specification, asynchronous operations are used when the result value
depends on work that happens on any timeline other than the [=Content timeline=].
They are represented by callbacks and promises in JavaScript.

<div class="example">
{{MLGraph/compute()|MLGraph.compute()}}:

  1. User issues a compute request by calling {{MLGraph/compute()|MLGraph.compute()}} on the [=Content timeline=] and gets a promise in return.
  2. User agent processes the compute request on the [=Device timeline=] by calling the OS ML API.
  3. After the ML device operating on [=Queue timeline=] is done, the user agent makes the results ready to be consumed by user and [=resolves=] the promise.

</div>

## Device Selection ## {#programming-model-device-selection}

An {{MLContext}} interface represents a global state of neural network execution. One of the important context states is the underlying execution device that manages the resources and facilitates the compilation and the eventual execution of the neural network graph. An {{MLContext}} could be created from a specific GPU device such as {{GPUDevice}} or {{WebGLRenderingContext}} that is already in use by the application, in which case the corresponding {{GPUBuffer}} or {{WebGLBuffer}} resources used as graph constants, as well as the {{GPUTexture}} and {{WebGLTexture}} as graph inputs must also be created from the same device. In a multi-adapter configuration, the device used for {{MLContext}} must be created from the same adapter as the device used to allocate the resources referenced in the graph.

In a situation when a GPU context executes a graph with a constant or an input in the system memory as an {{ArrayBufferView}}, the input content is automatically uploaded from the system memory to the GPU memory, and downloaded back to the system memory of an {{ArrayBufferView}} output buffer at the end of the graph execution. This data upload and download cycles will only occur whenever the execution device requires the data to be copied out of and back into the system memory, such as in the case of the GPU. It doesn't occur when the device is a CPU device. Additionally, the result of the graph execution is in a known layout format. While the execution may be optimized for a native memory access pattern in an intermediate result within the graph, the output of the last operation of the graph must convert the content back to a known layout format at the end of the graph in order to maintain the expected behavior from the caller's perspective.

When an {{MLContext}} is created with {{MLContextOptions}}, the user agent selects and creates the underlying execution device by taking into account the application's preference specified in the {{MLPowerPreference}} and the {{MLDevicePreference}} options:
- The *"gpu"* device provides the broadest range of achievable performance across graphics hardware platforms from consumer devices to professional workstations. 
- The *"cpu"* device provides the broadest reach of software compute availability, but with limited scalability of execution performance on the more complex neural networks. 
- When the device preference is not specified (*"default"*), the user agent selects the most suitable device to use. 

The following table summarizes the types of resource supported by the device selected.

<div class="note">
<table>
  <tr><th>Device Type<th>ArrayBufferView<th>GPUBuffer<th>GPUTexture<th>WebGLBuffer<th>WebGLTexture
  <tr><td>GPUDevice<td>Yes<td>Yes<td>Yes<td>No<td>No
  <tr><td>WebGLRenderingContext<td>Yes<td>No<td>No<td>Yes<td>Yes
  <tr><td>default<td>Yes<td>No<td>No<td>No<td>No
  <tr><td>gpu<td>Yes<td>No<td>No<td>No<td>No
  <tr><td>cpu<td>Yes<td>No<td>No<td>No<td>No
</table>
</div>

API {#api}
=====================

## navigator.ml ## {#api-navigator-ml}

A {{ML}} object is available in the {{Window}} and {{DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope}} contexts through the {{Navigator}}
and {{WorkerNavigator}} interfaces respectively and is exposed via `navigator.ml`:

<script type=idl>
interface mixin NavigatorML {
  [SecureContext, SameObject] readonly attribute ML ml;
};
Navigator includes NavigatorML;
WorkerNavigator includes NavigatorML;
</script>

## ML ## {#api-ml}
<script type=idl>
enum MLDevicePreference {
  "default",
  "gpu",
  "cpu"
};

enum MLPowerPreference {
  // Let the user agent select the most suitable behavior.
  "default",

  // Prioritizes execution speed over power consumption.
  "high-performance",
  
  // Prioritizes power consumption over other considerations such as execution speed.
  "low-power"
};

dictionary MLContextOptions {
  // Preferred kind of device used
  MLDevicePreference devicePreference = "default";

  // Preference as related to power consumption
  MLPowerPreference powerPreference = "default";
};

[SecureContext, Exposed=(Window, DedicatedWorker)]
interface ML {
  // Create a context with options
  MLContext createContext(optional MLContextOptions options = {});

  // Create a context from WebGL rendering context
  MLContext createContext(WebGLRenderingContext glContext);

  // Create a context from WebGPU device
  MLContext createContext(GPUDevice gpuDevice);
};
</script>

=======
The {{ML/createContext()}} method steps are:
1. If the [=responsible document=] is not [=allowed to use=] the [=webnn-feature|webnn=] feature, then throw a "{{SecurityError!!exception}}" {{DOMException}} and abort these steps.
1. Let |context| be a new {{MLContext}} object.
1. Switch on the method's first argument:
    <dl class=switch>
    <dt>{{MLContextOptions}}
    <dd>Set |context|'s [=context type=] to [=default-context|default=].

    <dt>{{WebGLRenderingContext}}
    <dd>Set |context|'s [=context type=] to [=webgl-context|webgl=].

    <dt>{{GPUDevice}}
    <dd>Set |context|'s [=context type=] to [=webgpu-context|webgpu=].

    <dt>Otherwise
    <dd>Set |context|'s [=context type=] to [=default-context|default=].
    </dl>
1. Return |context|.

Its <a>default allowlist</a> is <code>'self'</code>.

## MLContext ## {#api-mlcontext}
The {{MLContext}} interface represents a global state of neural network compute workload and execution processes.
<script type=idl>
[SecureContext, Exposed=(Window, DedicatedWorker)]
interface MLContext {};
</script>

The <dfn>context type</dfn> for an {{MLContext}} is either "<code><dfn data-lt="default-context">default</dfn></code>", "<code><dfn data-lt="webgl-context">webgl</dfn></code>" or "<code><dfn data-lt="webgpu-context">webgpu</dfn></code>".

enum MLInputOperandLayout {
  "nchw",
  "nhwc"
};

enum MLOperandType {
  "float32",
  "float16",
  "int32",
  "uint32",
  "int8",
  "uint8"
};

dictionary MLOperandDescriptor {
  // The operand type.
  required MLOperandType type;

  sequence<long> dimensions;
};
</script>

## MLOperand ## {#api-mloperand}
<script type=idl>
[SecureContext, Exposed=(Window, DedicatedWorker)]
interface MLOperand {};
</script>

## MLGraphBuilder ## {#api-mlgraphbuilder}

The {{MLGraphBuilder}} interface defines a set of operations as identified by the [[#usecases]] that can be composed into a computational graph. It also represents the intermediate state of a graph building session.

<script type=idl>
typedef record<DOMString, MLOperand> MLNamedOperands;

dictionary MLBufferResourceView {
  required (WebGLBuffer or GPUBuffer) resource;
  unsigned long long offset = 0;
  unsigned long long size;
};

typedef (ArrayBufferView or MLBufferResourceView) MLBufferView;

[SecureContext, Exposed=(Window, DedicatedWorker)]
interface MLGraphBuilder {
  // Construct the graph builder from the context.
  constructor(MLContext context);

  // Create an operand for a graph input.
  MLOperand input(DOMString name, MLOperandDescriptor desc);

  // Create an operand for a graph constant.
  MLOperand constant(MLOperandDescriptor desc, MLBufferView bufferView);

  // Create a single-value operand from the specified number of the specified type.
  MLOperand constant(double value, optional MLOperandType type = "float32");

  // Compile the graph up to the specified output operands
  Promise<MLGraph> build(MLNamedOperands outputs);
};
</script>

### batchNormalization ### {#api-mlgraphbuilder-batchnorm}
Normalize the tensor values of input features across the batch dimension using [[Batch-Normalization]]. For each input feature, the mean and variance values of that feature supplied in this calculation as parameters are previously computed across the batch dimension of the input during the model training phrase of this operation.
<script type=idl>
dictionary MLBatchNormalizationOptions {
  MLOperand scale;
  MLOperand bias;
  long axis = 1;
  float epsilon = 1e-5;
};

partial interface MLGraphBuilder {
  MLOperand batchNormalization(MLOperand input, MLOperand mean, MLOperand variance,
                             optional MLBatchNormalizationOptions options = {});
};
</script>
<div algorithm=batchnorm>
    **Arguments:**
        - *input*: an {{MLOperand}}. The input N-D tensor.
        - *mean*: an {{MLOperand}}. The 1-D tensor of the mean values of the input features across the batch whose length is equal to the size of the input dimension denoted by *options.axis*.
        - *variance*: an {{MLOperand}}. The 1-D tensor of the variance values of the input features across the batch whose length is equal to the size of the input dimension denoted by *options.axis*.
        - *options*: an optional {{MLBatchNormalizationOptions}}. The optional parameters of the operation.
              - *scale*: an {{MLOperand}}. The 1-D tensor of the scaling values whose length is equal to the size of the input dimension denoted by *options.axis*.
              - *bias*: an {{MLOperand}}. The 1-D tensor of the bias values whose length is equal to the size of the input dimension denoted by *options.axis*.
              - *axis*: a {{long}} scalar. The index to the feature count dimension of the input shape for which the mean and variance values are. When it's not specified, the default value is 1.
              - *epsilon*: a {{float}} scalar. A small value to prevent computational error due to divide-by-zero. The default value is 0.00001 when not specified.
        
    **Returns:** an {{MLOperand}}. The batch-normalized N-D tensor of the same shape as the input tensor.

    When *input* is a 4-D tensor of the *"nchw"* or *"nhwc"* layout, *options.axis* should be set to 1 or 3 respectively. The axis value designates the feature or channel count dimension of the input tensor.

    <div class="note">
    The behavior of this operation when the input tensor is 4-D of the *"nchw"* layout can be generically emulated from 
    the usage of other operations as follow. However, user agents typically have a more efficient implementation for it, 
    therefore its usage is encouraged from the performance standpoint.
    <pre highlight="js">
    const shape = [1,-1,1,1];
    return builder.add(
        builder.mul(
          builder.reshape(options.scale, shape),
          builder.div(
            builder.sub(input, builder.reshape(mean, shape)),
            builder.pow(

};

partial interface MLGraphBuilder {
  MLOperand conv2d(MLOperand input, MLOperand filter, optional MLConv2dOptions options = {});
};
</script>
<div algorithm=conv2d>
    **Arguments:**
        - *input*: an {{MLOperand}}. The input 4-D tensor. The logical shape
            is interpreted according to the value of *options.layout*.
        - *filter*: an {{MLOperand}}. The filter 4-D tensor. The logical shape is
            interpreted according to the value of *options.layout* and *options.groups*.
        - *options*: an optional {{MLConv2dOptions}}. The optional parameters of the operation.
            - *padding*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 4. The additional rows and columns added to the beginning and ending of each spatial dimension of *input*, [beginning_height, ending_height, beginning_width, ending_width]. If not present, the values are assumed to be [0,0,0,0].
            - *strides*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 2. The stride of the sliding window for each spatial dimension of *input*, [stride_height, stride_width]. If not present, the values are assumed to be [1,1].
            - *dilations*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 2. The dilation factor for each spatial dimension of *input*, [dilation_height, dilation_width]. If not present, the values are assumed to be [1,1].
            - *outputPadding*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 2. The padding values applied to each spatial dimension of the output tensor when *options.transpose* is set to true. This explicit padding values are needed to disambiguate the output tensor shape for transposed convolution when the value of the *options.strides* is greater than 1. Note that these values are only used to disambiguate output shape when needed; it does not necessarily cause any padding value to be written to the output tensor. If not specified, the values are assumed to be [0,0].
            - *outputSizes*: a sequence of {{long}} of length 2. The sizes of the last two dimensions of the output tensor when *options.transpose* is set to true. When the output sizes are explicitly specified, the output padding values in *options.outputPadding* are ignored. If not specified, the output sizes are automatically computed.
            - *autoPad*: an {{MLAutoPad}}. The automatic input padding options. By default, this argument is set to *"explicit"*, which means that the values in the *options.padding* array should be used for input padding. When the option is set other than *"explicit"*, the values in the *options.padding* array are ignored. With the *"same-upper"* option, the padding values are automatically computed such that the additional ending padding of the spatial input dimensions would allow all of the input values in the corresponding dimension to be filtered. The *"same-lower"* option is similar but padding is applied to the beginning padding of the spatial input dimensions instead of the ending one.
            - *transpose*: a {{boolean}} indicating that a transposed convolution operation is performed. Transposed convolution is used in upsampling networks to increase the resolution of a feature as opposed to the typical convolution process that reduces the feature's resolution. When transposed convolution is performed, *options.outputPadding* may be needed to disambiguate the output tensor shape. If not present, this option is assumed to be false.
            - *groups*: a {{long}} scalar. The number of groups that input channels and output channels are divided into, default to 1.
            - *inputLayout*: an {{MLInputOperandLayout}}. The default value is *"nchw"*. This option specifies the layout format of the input and output tensor as follow:

                "nchw":
                    - input tensor: [batches, input_channels, height, width]
                    - output tensor: [batches, output_channels, height, width]
                    
                "nhwc":
                    - input tensor: [batches, height, width, input_channels]
                    - output tensor: [batches, height, width, output_channels]

            - *filterLayout*: a {{MLFilterOperandLayout}}. The default value is *"oihw"*. This option specifies the layout format of the filter tensor as follow:

                "oihw":
                    - [output_channels, input_channels/groups, height, width]
                    
                "hwio":
                    - [height, width, input_channels/groups, output_channels]
                    
                "ohwi":
                    - [output_channels, height, width, input_channels/groups]

                "ihwo":
                    - [input_channels/groups, height, width, output_channels]

    **Returns:** an {{MLOperand}}. The output 4-D tensor that contains the convolution result. The output shape is interpreted according to the *options.layout* value. More specifically the sizes of the last two dimensions of the output tensor, the spatial dimensions, for the convolution operation can be calculated as follow:

    *output size = 1 + (input size - filter size + beginning padding + ending padding) / stride*

    Whereas for the transposed convolution case with *options.transpose* set to *true*, unless the *options.outputSizes* values are explicitly specified, the *options.outputPadding* may be needed to compute the spatial dimension values of the output tensor as follow:

    *output size = (input size - 1) ** *stride + filter size - beginning padding - ending padding + output padding*

    <div class="note">
    A *depthwise* conv2d operation is a variant of grouped convolution, used in models like the MobileNet, where the *options.groups* = input_channels = output_channels and the shape of filter tensor is [options.groups, 1, height, width]
    for *"oihw"* layout, [height, width, 1, options.groups] for *"hwio"* layout, [options.groups, height, width, 1] for *"ohwi"* layout and [1, height, width, options.groups] for *"ihwo"* layout.

### instanceNormalization ### {#api-mlgraphbuilder-instancenorm}
Normalize the input features using [[Instance-Normalization]]. Unlike [[#api-mlgraphbuilder-batchnorm]] where the mean and variance values used in the calculation are previously computed across the batch dimension during the model training phrase, the mean and variance values used in the calculation of an instance normalization are computed internally on the fly per input feature.

### matmul ### {#api-mlgraphbuilder-matmul}
Compute the matrix product of two input tensors.
<script type=idl>
partial interface MLGraphBuilder {

};
</script>
<div algorithm=matmul>
    **Arguments:**
        - *a*: an {{MLOperand}}. The first input N-D tensor.
        - *b*: an {{MLOperand}}. The second input N-D tensor.

    **Returns:** an {{MLOperand}}. The output N-D tensor that contains the matrix
    product of two input tensors.

    Compute the matrix product of two input tensors. It behaves as following:
        - If both *a* and *b* are 2-D, they are multiplied like conventional
            matrices and produce a 2-D tensor as the output.
        - If either *a* or *b* is N-D, N > 2, it is treated as a stack of
            matrices with dimensions corresponding to the last two indices. The
            matrix multiplication will be broadcasted accordingly by following
            [[!numpy-broadcasting-rule]]. The output is a N-D tensor whose rank
            is the maximum rank of the input tensors. For each dimension, except
            the last two, of the output tensor, its size is the maximum size
            along that dimension of the input tensors.
        - If *a* is 1-D, it is converted to a 2-D tensor by prepending a 1 to
            its dimensions.
        - If *b* is 1-D, it is converted to a 2-D tensor by by appending a 1 to
            its dimensions.
        - If both *a* and *b* are 1-D, the operation is a vector dot-product,
            which produces a scalar output.

            - *autoPad*: an {{MLAutoPad}}. The automatic input padding options.

### reshape ### {#api-mlgraphbuilder-reshape}
Alter the shape of a tensor to a new shape. Reshape does not copy or change the content of the tensor. It just changes the tensor's logical dimensions for the subsequent operations.
<script type=idl>
partial interface MLGraphBuilder {
  MLOperand reshape(MLOperand input, sequence<long> newShape);
};
</script>
<div algorithm=reshape>
    **Arguments:**

        - *newShape*: a sequence of {{long}}. The shape of the output tensor.
            The number of elements implied by *newShape* must be the same as the
            number of elements in the input tensor. Only one component of
            *newShape* can be the special value of -1. The size of the dimension
            with the value -1 is computed so that the total size remains
            constant.

    **Returns:** an {{MLOperand}}. The output tensor. The values of the output
    tensor are the same as values of the input tensor. The shape of the output

        - *options*: an optional {{MLSplitOptions}}. The optional parameters of the operation.
            - *axis*: a {{long}}. The dimension along which to split. Default to 0. A negative value is interpreted as counting back from the end.
