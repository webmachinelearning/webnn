Introduction {#intro}
=====================

We're working on this section. Meanwhile, please take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/blob/master/explainer.md">explainer</a>.

Use cases {#usecases}
=====================

## Application Use Cases ## {#usecases-application}

This section illustrates application-level use cases for neural network
inference hardware acceleration. All applications in those use cases can be
built on top of pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) [[models]].

### Person Detection ### {#usecase-person-detection}

A user opens a web-based video conferencing application, but she temporarily
leaves from her room. The application is watching whether she is in front of her
PC by using object detection (for example, using object detection approaches
such as [[SSD]] or [[YOLO]] that use a single DNN) to detect regions in a camera
input frame that include persons.

When she comes back, the application automatically detects her and notifies
other online users that she is active now.

### Semantic Segmentation ### {#usecase-segmentation}

A user joins a teleconference via a web-based video conferencing application at
her desk since no meeting room in her office is available. During the
teleconference, she does not wish that her room and people in the background are
visible. To protect the privacy of the other people and the surroundings, the
application runs a machine learning model such as [[DeepLabv3+]] or
[[MaskR-CNN]] to semantically split an image into segments and replaces
segments that represent other people and background with another picture.

### Skeleton Detection ### {#usecase-skeleton-detection}

A web-based video conferencing application tracks a pose of user's skeleton by
running a machine learning model, which allows for real-time human pose
estimation, such as [[PoseNet]] to recognize her gesture and body language. When
she raises her hand, her microphone is automatically unmuted and she can start
speaking on the teleconference.

### Face Recognition ### {#usecase-face-recognition}

There are multiple people in the conference room and they join an online meeting
using a web-based video conferencing application. The application detects faces
of participants by using object detection (for example, using object detection
approaches such as [[SSD]]) and checks whether each face was present at the
previous meeting or not by running a machine learning model such as [[FaceNet]],
which verifies whether two faces would be identical or not.

### Facial Landmark Detection ### {#usecase-facial-landmarks}

A user wants to find new glasses that beautifully fits her on an online glasses
store. The online store offers web-based try-on simulator that runs a machine
learning model such as Face Alignment Network [[FAN]] to detect facial landmarks
like eyes, nose, mouth, etc. When she chooses a pair of glasses, the simulator
properly render the selected glasses on the detected position of eyes on her
facial image.

### Style Transfer ### {#usecase-style-transfer}

A user is looking for cosmetics on an online store and wondering which color may
fit her face. The online store shows sample facial makeup images of cosmetics,
and offers makeup simulator that runs a machine learning model like
[[ContextualLoss]] or [[PairedCycleGAN]] to transfer the makeup style of the
sample makeup image to her facial image. She can check how the selected makeup
looks like on her face by the simulator.

### Super Resolution ### {#usecase-super-resolution}

A web-based video conferencing is receiving a video stream from its peer, but
the resolution of the video becomes lower due to network congestion. To prevent
degradation of the perceived video quality, the application runs a machine
learning model for super-resolution such as [[SRGAN]] to generate
higher-resolution video frames.

### Image Captioning ### {#usecase-image-captioning}

For better accessibility, a web-based presentation application provides
automatic image captioning by running a machine learning model such as
[[im2txt]] which predicts explanatory words of the presentation slides.

### Machine Translation ### {#usecase-translation}

Multiple people from various countries are talking via a web-based real-time
text chat application. The application translates their conversation by using a
machine learning model such as [[GNMT]] or [[OpenNMT]], which translates every
text into different language.

### Emotion Analysis ### {#usecase-emotion-analysis}

A user is talking to her friend via a web-based real-time text chat application,
and she is wondering how the friend feels because she cannot see the friend's
face. The application analyses the friend's emotion by using a machine learning
model such as [[DeepMoji]], which infers emotion from input texts, and displays
an emoji that represents the estimated emotion.

### Video Summarization ### {#usecase-video-summalization}

A web-based video conferencing application records received video streams, and
it needs to reduce recorded video data to be stored. The application generates
the short version of the recorded video by using a machine learning model for
video summarization such as [[Video-Summarization-with-LSTM]].

### Noise Suppression ### {#usecase-noise-suppression}

A web-based video conferencing application records received audio streams, but 
usually the background noise is everywhere. The application leverages real-time 
noise suppression using Recurrent Neural Network such as [[RNNoise]] for 
suppressing background dynamic noise like baby cry or dog barking to improve 
audio experiences in video conferences.

## Framework Use Cases ## {#usecases-framework}

This section collects framework-level use cases for a dedicated low-level API
for neural network inference hardware acceleration. It is expected that Machine
Learning frameworks will be key consumers of the Web Neural Network API (WebNN
API) and the low-level details exposed through the WebNN API are abstracted out
from typical web developers. However, it is also expected that web developers
with specific interest and competence in Machine Learning will want to interface
with the WebNN API directly instead of a higher-level ML framework.

### Custom Layer ### {#usecase-custom-layer}

A web application developer wants to run a DNN model on the WebNN API. However,
she has found that some of activation functions like [[LeakyReLU]], [[ELU]],
etc. are not included in the WebNN API. To address this issue, she constructs
custom layers of the additional activation functions on top of the WebNN API.
Note that the scope of custom layers may include convolution, normalization,
etc. as well as activation.

### Network Concatenation ### {#usecase-network-concat}

A web application uses a DNN model, and its model data of upper convolutional
layers and lower fully-connected layers are stored in separate files, since
model data of the fully-connected layers are periodically updated due to fine
tuning at the server side.

Therefore, the application downloads both partial model files at first and
concatenates them into a single model. When the model is updated, the
application downloads fine-tuned part of the model and replace only the
fully-connected layers with it.

### Performance Adaptation ### {#usecase-perf-adapt}

A web application developer has a concern about performance of her DNN model on
mobile devices. She has confirmed that it may run too slow on mobile devices
which do not have GPU acceleration. To address this issue, her web application
refers to the WebNN API to confirm whether acceleration is available or not, so
that the application can display the warning for devices without acceleration.

After several weeks, she has developed a tiny DNN model that can even run on
CPU. In order to accommodate CPU execution, she modifies the application
so that the application loads the tiny model in the case of CPU-only devices.

    <div class="note">
    The behavior of this operation when the input tensor is 4-D of the "nchw" layout can be generically emulated from 
    the usage of other operations as follow. However, user agents typically have a more efficient implementation for it,

### matmul ### {#api-modelbuilder-matmul}
Compute the matrix product of two input tensors.
<script type=idl>
partial interface ModelBuilder {

};
</script>

<div algorithm=matmul>
    **Arguments:**
        - *a*: an {{Operand}}. The first input N-D tensor.
        - *b*: an {{Operand}}. The second input N-D tensor.

    **Returns:** an {{Operand}}. The output N-D tensor that contains the matrix
    product of two input tensors.

    Compute the matrix product of two input tensors. It behaves as following:
        - If both *a* and *b* are 2-D, they are multiplied like conventional
            matrices and produce a 2-D tensor as the output.
        - If either *a* or *b* is N-D, N > 2, it is treated as a stack of
            matrices with dimensions corresponding to the last two indices. The
            matrix multiplication will be broadcasted accordingly by following
            [[!numpy-broadcasting-rule]]. The output is a N-D tensor whose rank
            is the maximum rank of the input tensors. For each dimension, except
            the last two, of the output tensor, its size is the maximum size
            along that dimension of the input tensors.
        - If *a* is 1-D, it is converted to a 2-D tensor by prepending a 1 to
            its dimensions.
        - If *b* is 1-D, it is converted to a 2-D tensor by by appending a 1 to
            its dimensions.
        - If both *a* and *b* are 1-D, the operation is a vector dot-product,
            which produces a scalar output.

  Operand softmax(Operand x);
};
</script>
<div algorithm=softmax>
    **Arguments:**
        - *x*: an {{Operand}}. The input 2-D tensor.

    **Returns:** an {{Operand}}. The output 2-D tensor that contains the softmax
    results, of the same shape as the input tensor.

    <div class="note">
    The behavior of this operation can be generically emulated from the usage of
    other operations as follow. However, user agents typically have a more
    efficient implementation for it, therefore its usage is encouraged from the
    performance standpoint.
    <pre highlight="js">
    // This sample deploys a well-known implementation trick [1] to compute the
    // exponentials of the distances to the max value, instead of the exponentials
    // of the input values itself, in order to increase the numerical stability of
    // the result.
    // [1]: https://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/#softmax
    const max_x = builder.reduceMax(x, /* axes = */ [1], /* keepDimensions = */ true);

</div>

### split ### {#api-modelbuilder-split}
Split the input tensor into a number of sub tensors along the given axis.
<script type=idl>
partial interface ModelBuilder {
  sequence<Operand> split(Operand input,
                          (unsigned long or sequence<unsigned long>) splits,
                          optional long axis = 0);
};
</script>
<div algorithm=split>
    **Arguments:**
        - *input*: an {{Operand}}. The input tensor.
        - *splits*: an {{unsigned long}} or a sequence of {{unsigned long}}. If an {{unsigned long}}, it specifies the number of output tensors along the axis. The number must evenly divide the dimension size of *input* along *axis*. If a sequence of {{unsigned long}}, it specifies the sizes of each output tensor along the *axis*. The sum of sizes must equal to the dimension size of *input* along *axis*.
        - *axis*: a {{long}}. The dimension along which to split. Default to 0. A negative value is interpreted as counting back from the end.

    **Returns:** a sequence of {{Operand}}. The splitted output tensors. If *splits* is an {{unsigned long}}, the length of the output sequence equals to *splits*. The shape of each output tensor is the same as *input* except the dimension size of *axis* equals to the quotient of dividing the dimension size of *input* along *axis* by *splits*. If *splits* is a sequence of {{unsigned long}}, the length of the output sequence equals to the length of *splits*. The shape of the i-th output tensor is the same as as *input* except along *axis* where the dimension size is *splits[i]*.

    <div class="note">
    The behavior of this operation can be generically emulated from the usage of
    other operations as follow. However, user agents typically have a more
    efficient implementation for it, therefore its usage is encouraged from the
    performance standpoint.
    <pre highlight="js">
    // This sample shows the case that the splits parameter is an array.
    const outputs = [];
    let start = 0;
    for (const size of splits) {
      outputs.push(builder.slice(input, [start], [size], [axis]));
      start += size;
    }
    return outputs;
    </pre>
    </div>
</div>

### squeeze ### {#api-modelbuilder-squeeze}
Reduce the rank of a tensor without affecting its values by eliminating dimensions with size 1 of the tensor shape.
<script type=idl>
partial interface ModelBuilder {
  Operand squeeze(Operand input, optional sequence<long> axes);
};
</script>
<div algorithm=squeeze>
    **Arguments:**
        - *input*: an {{Operand}}. The input tensor.
        - *axes*: an optional sequence of {{long}}. Indices to the shape dimensions of size 1 to eliminate. When not specified, every shape dimensions of size 1 in the tensor are eliminated.

    **Returns:** an {{Operand}}. The output tensor of the same or reduced rank with the shape dimensions of size 1 eliminated.
</div>

### transpose ### {#api-modelbuilder-transpose}
Permute the dimensions of the input tensor according to the *permutation* argument.
<script type=idl>
partial interface ModelBuilder {
  Operand transpose(Operand input, optional sequence<long> permutation);
};
</script>
<div algorithm=transpose>
    **Arguments:**
        - *input*: an {{Operand}}. The input N-D tensor.
        - *permutation*: an optional sequence of {{long}} values. The values used to permute the output shape. When it's not specified, it's set to `[N-1...0]`, where `N` is the rank of the input tensor. These default values cause the output to become a transposed tensor of the input. When specified, the number of values in the sequence must be the same as the rank of the input tensor, and the values in the sequence must be within the range from 0 to N-1 with no two or more same values found in the sequence.

    **Returns:** an {{Operand}}. The permuted or transposed N-D tensor. 
</div>

## Model ## {#api-model}
The {{Model}} interface represents an immutable computational graph constructed by the {{ModelBuilder}} interface. The operands to the starting operations of the graph are assumed to be the model's input operands.

<script type=idl>
enum PowerPreference {
  // Let the user agent decide the most suitable behavior. This is the default value.
  "default",
  // Prioritizes execution speed over other considerations e.g. power consumption
  "high-performance",
  // Prioritizes power consumption over other considerations e.g. execution speed
  "low-power"
};

dictionary CompilationOptions {
  // Compilation preference as related to power consumption level
  PowerPreference powerPreference = "default";
};

[SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
interface Model {
  Promise<Compilation> compile(optional CompilationOptions options = {});
};
</script>

## Compilation ## {#api-compilation}
The {{Compilation}} interface represents a compiled version of the computational graph of a {{Model}} according to the compilation options. A compilation of a graph once constructed is immutable and cannot be subsequently changed.

<script type=idl>
dictionary Input {
  required ArrayBufferView buffer;
  sequence<long> dimensions;
};

dictionary Output {
  ArrayBufferView buffer;
  sequence<long> dimensions;
};

typedef record<DOMString, Input> NamedInputs;
typedef record<DOMString, Output> NamedOutputs;

[SecureContext, Exposed=Window]
interface Compilation {
  Promise<NamedOutputs> compute(NamedInputs inputs, optional NamedOutputs outputs);
};
</script>
