Status Text: <p>
  Further implementation experience and user feedback is being gathered for the
  {{MLCommandEncoder}} interface that proposes to enable more efficient WebGPU
  integration. A proposal to
  <a href="https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/pull/322">simplify
  MLContext creation</a> is being discussed. This document is maintained and
  updated at any time. Some parts of this document are work in progress and
  further improvements are expected to be reflected in revised Candidate
  Recommendation Drafts and Snaphots.
  </p>
  <p>Before requesting transition to <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/types#PR">Proposed Recommendation</a>, the Working Group will seek to demonstrate that:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>the API is implementable on top of existing APIs of major platforms, such as Android, Windows and macOS/iOS;</li>
  <li>it has at least two independent, interoperable implementations of every feature defined in the specification, where interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or more implementations interoperating with each other;</li>
  <li>it has an open test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</li>
  </ul>

Introduction {#intro}
=====================

The Web Neural Network API defines a web-friendly hardware-agnostic abstraction layer that makes use of Machine Learning capabilities of operating systems and underlying hardware platforms without being tied to platform-specific capabilities. The abstraction layer addresses the requirements of key Machine Learning JavaScript frameworks and also allows web developers familiar with the ML domain to write custom code without the help of libraries. A complementary <a href="https://webmachinelearning.github.io/model-loader/">Model Loader API</a> defines a higher-level abstraction targeting primarily web developers.

For an illustrated introduction, please see the <a href="https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/blob/master/explainer.md">explainer</a>.

Use cases {#usecases}
=====================

## Application Use Cases ## {#usecases-application}

This section illustrates application-level use cases for neural network
inference hardware acceleration. All applications in those use cases can be
built on top of pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) [[models]].

Note: Please be aware that some of the use cases described here, are by their very nature, privacy-invasive. Developers who are planning to use the API for such use cases should ensure that the API is being used to benefit users, for purposes that users understand, and approve. They should apply the Ethical Principles for Web Machine Learning [[webmachinelearning-ethics]] and implement appropriate privacy risk mitigations such as transparency, data minimisation, and users controls.

### Person Detection ### {#usecase-person-detection}

A user opens a web-based video conferencing application, but she temporarily
leaves from her room. The application is watching whether she is in front of her
PC by using object detection (for example, using object detection approaches
such as [[SSD]] or [[YOLO]] that use a single DNN) to detect regions in a camera
input frame that include persons.

When she comes back, the application automatically detects her and notifies
other online users that she is active now.

### Semantic Segmentation ### {#usecase-segmentation}

A user joins a teleconference via a web-based video conferencing application at
her desk since no meeting room in her office is available. During the
teleconference, she does not wish that her room and people in the background are
visible. To protect the privacy of the other people and the surroundings, the
application runs a machine learning model such as [[DeepLabv3+]] or
[[MaskR-CNN]] to semantically split an image into segments and replaces
segments that represent other people and background with another picture.

### Skeleton Detection ### {#usecase-skeleton-detection}

A web-based video conferencing application tracks a pose of user's skeleton by
running a machine learning model, which allows for real-time human pose
estimation, such as [[PoseNet]] to recognize her gesture and body language. When
she raises her hand, her microphone is automatically unmuted and she can start
speaking on the teleconference.

### Face Recognition ### {#usecase-face-recognition}

There are multiple people in the conference room and they join an online meeting
using a web-based video conferencing application. The application detects faces
of participants by using object detection (for example, using object detection
approaches such as [[SSD]]) and checks whether each face was present at the
previous meeting or not by running a machine learning model such as [[FaceNet]],
which verifies whether two faces would be identical or not.

### Facial Landmark Detection ### {#usecase-facial-landmarks}

A user wants to find new glasses that beautifully fits her on an online glasses
store. The online store offers web-based try-on simulator that runs a machine
learning model such as Face Alignment Network [[FAN]] to detect facial landmarks
like eyes, nose, mouth, etc. When she chooses a pair of glasses, the simulator
properly renders the selected glasses on the detected position of eyes on her
facial image.

### Style Transfer ### {#usecase-style-transfer}

A user is looking for cosmetics on an online store and wondering which color may
fit her face. The online store shows sample facial makeup images of cosmetics,
and offers makeup simulator that runs a machine learning model like
[[ContextualLoss]] or [[PairedCycleGAN]] to transfer the makeup style of the
sample makeup image to her facial image. She can check how the selected makeup
looks like on her face by the simulator.

### Super Resolution ### {#usecase-super-resolution}

A web-based video conferencing is receiving a video stream from its peer, but
the resolution of the video becomes lower due to network congestion. To prevent
degradation of the perceived video quality, the application runs a machine
learning model for super-resolution such as [[SRGAN]] to generate
higher-resolution video frames.

### Image Captioning ### {#usecase-image-captioning}

For better accessibility, a web-based presentation application provides
automatic image captioning by running a machine learning model such as
[[im2txt]] which predicts explanatory words of the presentation slides.

### Machine Translation ### {#usecase-translation}

Multiple people from various countries are talking via a web-based real-time
text chat application. The application translates their conversation by using a
machine learning model such as [[GNMT]] or [[OpenNMT]], which translates every
text into different language.

### Emotion Analysis ### {#usecase-emotion-analysis}

A user is talking to her friend via a web-based real-time text chat application,
and she is wondering how the friend feels because she cannot see the friend's
face. The application analyses the friend's emotion by using a machine learning
model such as [[DeepMoji]], which infers emotion from input texts, and displays
an emoji that represents the estimated emotion.

### Video Summarization ### {#usecase-video-summalization}

A web-based video conferencing application records received video streams, and
it needs to reduce recorded video data to be stored. The application generates
the short version of the recorded video by using a machine learning model for
video summarization such as [[Video-Summarization-with-LSTM]].

### Noise Suppression ### {#usecase-noise-suppression}

A web-based video conferencing application records received audio streams, but
usually the background noise is everywhere. The application leverages real-time
noise suppression using Recurrent Neural Network such as [[RNNoise]] for
suppressing background dynamic noise like baby cry or dog barking to improve
audio experiences in video conferences.

### Detecting fake video ### {#usecase-detecting-fake-video}

A user is exposed to realistic fake videos generated by ‘deepfake’ on the web.
The fake video can swap the speaker’s face into the president’s face to incite
a user politically or to manipulate user’s opinion. The deepfake detection
applications such as [[FaceForensics++]] analyze the videos and protect a user against
the fake videos or images. When she watches a fake video on the web, the
detection application alerts her of the fraud video in real-time.

## Framework Use Cases ## {#usecases-framework}

This section collects framework-level use cases for a dedicated low-level API
for neural network inference hardware acceleration. It is expected that Machine
Learning frameworks will be key consumers of the Web Neural Network API (WebNN
API) and the low-level details exposed through the WebNN API are abstracted out
from typical web developers. However, it is also expected that web developers
with specific interest and competence in Machine Learning will want to interface
with the WebNN API directly instead of a higher-level ML framework.

### Custom Layer ### {#usecase-custom-layer}

A web application developer wants to run a DNN model on the WebNN API. However,
she has found that some of activation functions like [[LeakyReLU]], [[ELU]],
etc. are not included in the WebNN API. To address this issue, she constructs
custom layers of the additional activation functions on top of the WebNN API.
Note that the scope of custom layers may include convolution, normalization,
etc. as well as activation.

### Network Concatenation ### {#usecase-network-concat}

A web application uses a DNN model, and its model data of upper convolutional
layers and lower fully-connected layers are stored in separate files, since
model data of the fully-connected layers are periodically updated due to fine
tuning at the server side.

Therefore, the application downloads both partial model files at first and
concatenates them into a single model. When the model is updated, the
application downloads fine-tuned part of the model and replace only the
fully-connected layers with it.

### Performance Adaptation ### {#usecase-perf-adapt}

A web application developer has a concern about performance of her DNN model on
mobile devices. She has confirmed that it may run too slow on mobile devices
which do not have GPU acceleration. To address this issue, her web application
refers to the WebNN API to confirm whether acceleration is available or not, so
that the application can display the warning for devices without acceleration.

After several weeks, she has developed a tiny DNN model that can even run on
CPU. In order to accommodate CPU execution, she modifies the application
so that the application loads the tiny model in the case of CPU-only devices.

### Operation Level Execution ### {#usecase-op-level-exec}

A JavaScript ML framework is responsible for loading, interpreting and executing a ML model. During the model execution phase, the framework iterates through the operations of the model and executes each operation on the hardware device, like CPU, GPU or ML accelerator. To avoid the unnecessary data copying across devices, the framework selects the same device to execute the operations. For a compute intensive operation, such as convolution 2D or matrix multiplication, the framework uses WebNN API to execute it with the ML-specific acceleration available on that selected device.

### Integration with real-time video processing ### {#usecase-real-time-video-processing}

The user experience of WebRTC-based video conferencing is enhanced using real-time video processing. For example, background blur implemented using a [[#usecase-segmentation]] model blurs the background in the user's live camera feed. To satisfy the performance requirements of this use case, the WebNN API integrates with primitives from other Web APIs that make up the media pipeline to allow WebNN API-based transformation of real-time video streams.

Security Considerations {#security}
===================================
This specification defines a low-level API for neural network inference hardware acceleration. This API is considered a powerful feature [[POWERFUL-FEATURES]] because it grants low-level access to a user's computer. To meet the authentication and confidentiality expectations of a powerful feature and to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, all interfaces defined by this specification are only available in a secure context.

This API is disabled by default in all cross-origin frames using the [[#permissions-policy-integration]]. This prevents third-party content from using this API unless the embedding page explicitly sets a policy that grants permission.

This API allows creation of an {{MLContext}} from a {{GPUDevice}} defined by WebGPU specification. See <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#security-considerations">WebGPU Security Considerations</a> for more information regarding security characteristics of this context.

Once the graph is fully constructed and compiled, the input shapes into each of the operations in the graph are inferred and finalized. The bounds checking occurs when the compute method is invoked that executes the graph against the actual data. No actual data is bound to the compiled graph before this stage. It is the implementation's responsibility to make sure proper bounds checking occurs against the shapes of the data already inferred by that time.

Issue: Document operations susceptible to out-of-bounds access as a guidance to implementers.

As a future-proofing measure, the API design allows certain operations that can be generically emulated to be deprecated for security, performance, or other reasons without breaking compatibility. This is made possible by high-level functions that are defined in terms of smaller primitive operations defined in this specifications. This enables a native implementation of a high-level function to be replaced with a polyfill implementation.

Issue: Investigate side channel attack feasibility considering the current state where CPU is shared between processes running renderers.

In order to not allow an attacker to target a specific implementation that may contain a flaw, the [[#programming-model-device-selection]] mechanism is a hint only, and the concrete device selection is left to the implementation - a user agent could for instance choose never to run a model on a device with known vulnerabilities. As a further mitigation, no device enumeration mechanism is defined.

Issue: Hinting partially mitigates the concern. Investigate additional mitigations.

The API design minimizes the attack surface for the compiled computational graph. The {{MLGraphBuilder}} interface that hosts the various operations is a data definition API and as such doesn't execute anything, only constructs data. What follows, is that the potential for an attack is limited to when binding the data to the graph before executing it by invoking the {{MLContext}}.{{MLContext/compute()}} method. This enables implementers to focus on hardening the {{MLContext}}.{{MLContext/compute()}} method. For example, by making sure it honors the boundary of data and fails appropriately when the bounds are not respected.

Purpose-built Web APIs for measuring high-resolution time mitigate against timing attacks using techniques such as resolution reduction, adding jitter, detection of abuse and API call throttling [[hr-time-3]]. The practical deployment of WebNN implementations are likely to bring enough jitter to make timing attacks impractical (e.g. because they would use IPC) but implementers are advised to consider and test their implementations against timing attacks.

## Guidelines for new operations ## {#security-new-ops}

To ensure operations defined in this specification are shaped in a way they can be implemented securely, this section includes guidelines on how operations are expected to be defined to reduce potential for implementation problems. These guidelines are expected to evolve over time to align with industry best practices:

- Prefer simplicity of arguments
- Don't use parsers for complex data formats
- If an operation can be decomposed to low level primitives:
    - Add an informative emulation path
    - Prefer primitives over new high level operations but consider performance consequences
- Operations should follow a consistent style for inputs and attributes
- Operation families such as pooling and reduction should share API shape and options
- Formalize failure cases into test cases whenever possible
- When in doubt, leave it out: API surface should be as small as possible required to satisfy the use cases, but no smaller
- Try to keep the API free of implementation details that might inhibit future evolution, do not overspecify
- Fail fast: the sooner the web developer is informed of an issue, the better

In general, always consider the security and privacy implications as documented in [[security-privacy-questionnaire]] by the Technical Architecture Group and the Privacy Interest Group when adding new features.

Privacy Considerations {#privacy}
===================================

This API enhances privacy compared to cloud-based inference, since input data such as locally sourced images or video streams stay within the browser's sandbox.

This API exposes the minimum amount of information necessary to address the identified [[#usecases]] for the best performance and reliability of results.

No information from the underlying platform is exposed directly. An execution time analysis may reveal indirectly the performance of the underlying platform's neural network hardware acceleration capabilities relative to another underlying platform.

Note: The group is <a href="https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/85">soliciting further input</a> on the proposed execution time analysis fingerprinting vector and will augment this section with more information and mitigations to inform the implementers of this API.

Unlike WebGPU, this API does not intrinsically support custom shader authoring; and as a result is not prone to timing attacks that rely on shader caches, or other persistent data. The API builds upon pre-existing shaders and lower level primitives of the browser or the underlying OS. Web developers who interface with {{GPUDevice}} are expected to be aware of <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#privacy-user-agent-state">WebGPU compilation cache considerations</a>.

The WebGPU API identifies <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#privacy-machine-artifacts">machine-specific artifacts</a> as a privacy consideration. Given the WebNN API defines means to record an ML workload onto a WebGPU-compatible {{GPUCommandBuffer}}, compute unit scheduling may under certain circumstances introduce a fingerprint. However, similarly to WebGPU, such fingerprints are identical across most or all of the devices of each vendor, mitigating the concern. Furthermore, software implementations can be used to further eliminate such artifacts.

The WebNN API defines two developer-settable preferences to help inform [[#programming-model-device-selection]] and allow the implementation to better select the most appropriate underlying execution device for the workload. [=Device type=] normatively indicates the kind of device and is either "cpu" or "gpu". If this type cannot be satisfied, an "{{OperationError}}" {{DOMException}} is thrown, thus this type can in some cases add two bits of entropy to the fingerprint. [=Power preference=] indicates preference as related to the power consumption and is considered a hint only and as such does not increase entropy of the fingerprint.

If a future version of this specification introduces support for new a  [=device type=] that can only support a subset of {{MLOperandType}}s, that may introduce a new fingerprint.

Ethical Considerations {#ethics}
===================================

The Working Group has started documenting ethical issues associated with using Machine Learning on the Web, to help identify what mitigations its normative specifications should take into account. The Working Group publishes and maintains an Ethical Principles for Web Machine Learning document [[webmachinelearning-ethics]] open to contributions from the wider community via a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webmachinelearning-ethics">GitHub repository</a>.

# Programming Model # {#programming-model}
## Overview ## {#programming-model-overview}

At the heart of neural networks is a computational graph of mathematical operations.
These operations are the building blocks of modern machine learning technologies in
computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.
The WebNN API is a specification for constructing, compiling, and executing computational
graphs of neural networks.

The {{MLGraph}} interface represents a compiled computational graph that is immutable (that is, a model).

The {{MLGraphBuilder}} interface serves as a builder (factory) to create an {{MLGraph}}.
An {{MLOperand}} is a representation of data that flows within the computational graph,
which include input-values for inference, constants (including trained weights)
used for inference, intermediate values (often referred to as activations) computed
during inference, as well as the output values of inference.
At inference time, every {{MLOperand}} will be bound to a tensor (the actual data).

The {{MLGraphBuilder}} interface enables the creation of {{MLOperand}}s.
A key part of the {{MLGraphBuilder}} interface are the operations (such as
{{MLGraphBuilder}}.{{MLGraphBuilder/gemm()}} and {{MLGraphBuilder}}.{{MLGraphBuilder/softmax()}}). The operations have a functional
semantics, with no side effects.
Each operation invocation conceptually returns a distinct new value, without
changing the value of any other {{MLOperand}}.

The runtime values (of {{MLOperand}}s) are tensors, which are essentially multidimensional
arrays. The representation of the tensors is implementation dependent, but it typically
includes the array data stored in some buffer (memory) and some metadata describing the
array data (such as its shape).

As mentioned above, the operations have a functional semantics. This allows the implementation
to potentially share the array data between multiple tensors. For example, the implementation
of operations such as reshape, or slice, or squeeze may return a view of its input tensor
that shares the same buffer as the input tensor. (In the case of reshape or squeeze,
the entire data is shared, while in the case of slice, a part of the input data is shared.)
The implementation may use views, as above, for intermediate values.

Before the execution, the computation graph that is used to compute one or more specified outputs needs to be compiled and optimized. The key purpose of the compilation step is to enable optimizations that span two or more operations, such as operation or loop fusion.

There are multiple ways by which the graph may be compiled. The {{MLGraphBuilder}}.{{MLGraphBuilder/build()}} method compiles the graph in the background without blocking the calling thread, and returns a {{Promise}} that resolves to an {{MLGraph}}. The {{MLGraphBuilder}}.{{MLGraphBuilder/buildSync()}} method compiles the graph immediately on the calling thread, which must be a worker thread running on CPU or GPU device, and returns an {{MLGraph}}. Both compilation methods produce an {{MLGraph}} that represents a compiled graph for optimal execution.

Once the {{MLGraph}} is constructed, there are multiple ways by which the graph may be executed. The
{{MLContext}}.{{MLContext/computeSync()}} method represents a way the execution of the graph is carried out immediately
on the calling thread, which must also be a worker thread, either on a CPU or GPU device. The execution
produces the results of the computation from all the inputs bound to the graph.

The {{MLContext}}.{{MLContext/compute()}} method represents a way the execution of the graph is performed asynchronously
either on a parallel timeline in a separate worker thread for the CPU execution or on a GPU timeline in a GPU
command queue. This method returns immediately without blocking the calling thread while the actual execution is
offloaded to a different timeline. This type of execution is appropriate when the responsiveness of the calling
thread is critical to good user experience. The computation results will be placed at the bound outputs at the
time the operation is successfully completed on the offloaded timeline at which time the calling thread is
signaled. This type of execution supports both the CPU and GPU device.

In both the {{MLContext}}.{{MLContext/compute()}} and {{MLContext}}.{{MLContext/computeSync()}} execution methods, the caller supplies
the input values using {{MLNamedArrayBufferViews}}, binding the input {{MLOperand}}s to their values. The caller
then supplies pre-allocated buffers for output {{MLOperand}}s using {{MLNamedArrayBufferViews}}.

The {{MLCommandEncoder}} interface created by the {{MLContext}}.{{MLContext/createCommandEncoder()}} method supports
a graph execution method that provides the maximum flexibility to callers that also utilize WebGPU in their
application. It does this by placing the workload required to initialize and compute the results of the
operations in the graph onto a {{GPUCommandBuffer}}. The callers are responsible for the eventual submission
of this workload on the {{GPUQueue}} through the WebGPU queue submission mechanism. Once the submitted workload
is completely executed, the result is avaialble in the bound output buffers.

## Device Selection ## {#programming-model-device-selection}

An {{MLContext}} interface represents a global state of neural network execution. One of the important context states is the underlying execution device that manages the resources and facilitates the compilation and the eventual execution of the neural network graph. In addition to the default method of creation with {{MLContextOptions}}, an {{MLContext}} could also be created from a specific {{GPUDevice}} that is already in use by the application, in which case the corresponding {{GPUBuffer}} resources used as graph constants, as well as the {{GPUTexture}} as graph inputs must also be created from the same device. In a multi-adapter configuration, the device used for {{MLContext}} must be created from the same adapter as the device used to allocate the resources referenced in the graph.

In a situation when a GPU context executes a graph with a constant or an input in the system memory as an {{ArrayBufferView}}, the input content is automatically uploaded from the system memory to the GPU memory, and downloaded back to the system memory of an {{ArrayBufferView}} output buffer at the end of the graph execution. This data upload and download cycles will only occur whenever the execution device requires the data to be copied out of and back into the system memory, such as in the case of the GPU. It doesn't occur when the device is a CPU device. Additionally, the result of the graph execution is in a known layout format. While the execution may be optimized for a native memory access pattern in an intermediate result within the graph, the output of the last operation of the graph must convert the content back to a known layout format at the end of the graph in order to maintain the expected behavior from the caller's perspective.

When an {{MLContext}} is created with {{MLContextOptions}}, the user agent selects and creates the underlying execution device by taking into account the application's [=power preference=] and [=device type=] specified in the {{MLPowerPreference}} and {{MLDeviceType}} options.

The following table summarizes the types of resource supported by the context created through different method of creation:

<div class="note">
<table>
  <tr><th>Creation method<th>ArrayBufferView<th>GPUBuffer<th>GPUTexture
  <tr><td>MLContextOptions<td>Yes<td>No<td>No
  <tr><td>GPUDevice<td>Yes<td>Yes<td>Yes

    1. Return |elementLength| × |elementSize|.
  </div>
</details>

### The MLOperand interface ### {#api-mloperand}

An {{MLOperand}} represents an intermediary graph being constructed as a result of compositing parts of an operation into a fully composed operation.

For instance, an {{MLOperand}} may represent a constant feeding to an operation or the result from combining multiple constants together into an operation. See also [[#programming-model]].

<script type=idl>
[SecureContext, Exposed=(Window, DedicatedWorker)]
interface MLOperand {};

<div class=internal-slots>
{{MLOperand}} has the following internal slots:

<div class=algorithm-steps>
    1. Return the [=list/size=] of |operand|.{{MLOperand/[[descriptor]]}}.{{MLOperandDescriptor/dimensions}}.
</div>
</div>

Since the {{MLOperand/[[builder]]}} object is bound by the {{MLGraphBuilder/constructor()}} constructor to an {{MLContext}} object, an {{MLOperand}} is also always bound to the same {{MLContext}} object.

#### Creating {{MLOperand}} #### {#api-mloperand-create}

### The MLActivation interface ### {#api-mlactivation}

Objects implementing the {{MLActivation}} interface represent activation function types.

<div class="note">
These activations function types are used to create other operations. One such use of this interface is for when an activation function is fused into another operation such as [[#api-mlgraphbuilder-conv2d]] or [[#api-mlgraphbuilder-batchnorm]] during a graph construction session. Such fused activation functions can provide a significant performance improvement when supported natively by the underlying implementation. This is intended as an optimization opportunity for implementers.

#### Creating {{MLActivation}} #### {#api-mlactivation-create}
<div class="note">
The {{MLActivation}} objects (including the ones passed as input to methods) are created by the methods of {{MLGraphBuilder}} and are identified by their name.

## The MLContext interface ## {#api-mlcontext}
The {{MLContext}} interface represents a global state of neural network compute workload and execution processes. Each {{MLContext}} object has associated [=context type=], [=device type=] and [=power preference=].

The <dfn>context type</dfn> is the type of the execution context that manages the resources and facilitates the compilation and execution of the neural network graph:
<dl>

<dd>Context created per user preference options.</dd>
<dt>"<code><dfn data-lt="webgpu-context">webgpu</dfn></code>"</dt>
<dd>Context created from WebGPU device.</dd>
</dl>

The <dfn>device type</dfn> indicates the kind of device used for the context. It is one of the following:
<dl>
<dt>"<code><dfn data-lt="device-type-cpu">cpu</dfn></code>"</dt>
<dd>Provides the broadest compatibility and usability across all client devices with varying degrees of performance.</dd>
<dt>"<code><dfn data-lt="device-type-gpu">gpu</dfn></code>"</dt>
<dd>Provides the broadest range of achievable performance across graphics hardware platforms from consumer devices to professional workstations.</dd>

### Asynchronous Execution ### {#api-mlcontext-async-execution}
Asynchronously carries out the computational workload of a compiled graph {{MLGraph}} on a separate timeline, either on a worker thread for the CPU execution, or on a GPU timeline for the submission of GPU workload on the command queue. The asynchronous nature of this call avoids blocking the calling thread while the computation for result is ongoing.

### WebGPU Interoperability ### {#api-mlcontext-webgpu-interop}
Create {{MLCommandEncoder}} interface used to record the ML workload onto a WebGPU-compatible {{GPUCommandBuffer}} to allow mixing of ML workload with other GPU workload in an application that leverages WebGPU. This method only succeeds on an {{MLContext}} created with {{GPUDevice}}. Otherwise, it[=exception/throws=] an "{{OperationError}}" {{DOMException}}.

## The MLCommandEncoder interface ## {#api-mlcommandencoder}
The {{MLCommandEncoder}} interface represents a method of execution that synchronously records the computational workload of a compiled {{MLGraph}} to a {{GPUCommandBuffer}} on the calling thread. Since the workload is not immediately executed, just recorded, this method allows more flexibility for the caller to determine how and when the recorded commands will be submitted for execution on the GPU relative to other GPU workload on the same or different queue.

## The MLGraphBuilder interface ## {#api-mlgraphbuilder}

The {{MLGraphBuilder}} interface defines a set of operations as identified by the [[#usecases]] that can be composed into a computational graph. It also represents the intermediate state of a graph building session.

<script type=idl>
typedef record<DOMString, MLOperand> MLNamedOperands;

dictionary MLBufferResourceView {
  required GPUBuffer resource;
  unsigned long long offset = 0;
  unsigned long long size;
};

typedef (ArrayBufferView or MLBufferResourceView) MLBufferView;

[SecureContext, Exposed=(Window, DedicatedWorker)]
interface MLGraphBuilder {
  // Construct the graph builder from the context.
  constructor(MLContext context);

  // Create an operand for a graph input.
  MLOperand input(DOMString name, MLOperandDescriptor descriptor);

  // Create an operand for a graph constant.
  MLOperand constant(MLOperandDescriptor descriptor, MLBufferView bufferView);

  // Create a single-value operand from the specified number of the specified type.
  MLOperand constant(double value, optional MLOperandType type = "float32");

  // Compile the graph up to the specified output operands asynchronously.
  Promise<MLGraph> build(MLNamedOperands outputs);

  // Compile the graph up to the specified output operands synchronously.
  [Exposed=(DedicatedWorker)]
  MLGraph buildSync(MLNamedOperands outputs);
};
</script>

<div class="note">
Both {{MLGraphBuilder}}.{{MLGraphBuilder/build()}} and {{MLGraphBuilder}}.{{MLGraphBuilder/buildSync()}} methods compile the graph builder state up to the specified output operands into a compiled graph according to the type of {{MLContext}} that creates it. Since this operation can be costly in some machine configurations, the calling thread of the {{MLGraphBuilder}}.{{MLGraphBuilder/buildSync()}} method must only be a worker thread to avoid potential disruption of the user experience. When the {{[[contextType]]}} of the {{MLContext}} is set to "[=default-context|default=]", the compiled graph is initialized right before the {{MLGraph}} is returned. This graph initialization stage is important for optimal performance of the subsequent graph executions. See [[#api-mlcommandencoder-graph-initialization]] for more detail.

{{MLConv2dOptions}} has the following members:
<dl dfn-type=dict-member dfn-for=MLConv2dOptions>
    : <dfn>padding</dfn>
    ::
        A sequence of {{unsigned long}} of length 4: [beginningHeight, endingHeight, beginningWidth, endingWidth].
        Specifies the additional rows and columns added to the beginning and ending of each spatial dimension of the convolution input.
        The default value is [0, 0, 0, 0].

    : <dfn>strides</dfn>
    ::
        A sequence of {{unsigned long}} of length 2: [strideHeight, strideWidth].
        Specifies the stride of the sliding window for each spatial dimension of the convolution input.
        The default value is [1, 1].

    : <dfn>dilations</dfn>
    ::
        A sequence of {{unsigned long}} of length 2: [dilationHeight, dilationWidth]. Specifies the dilation factor for each spatial dimension applied on the convolution filter (kernel).
        The default value is [1, 1].

    : <dfn>autoPad</dfn>
    ::
        An {{MLAutoPad}} [=string=].
        Specifies the automatic input padding options.
        The default value is *"explicit"*, which means that the values in the {{MLConv2dOptions/padding}} array should be used for input padding.
        When the option is set other than *"explicit"*, the values in the {{MLConv2dOptions/padding}} array are ignored.

        With the *"same-upper"* option, the padding values are automatically computed such that the additional ending padding of the spatial input dimensions would allow all of the input values in the corresponding dimension to be filtered.

        The *"same-lower"* option is similar but padding is applied to the beginning padding of the spatial input dimensions instead of the ending one.

    : <dfn>groups</dfn>
    ::
        An {{unsigned long}} scalar.
        Specifies the number of groups that input channels and output channels are divided into.
        The default value is 1.

                - input tensor: *[batches, height, width, inputChannels]*
                - output tensor: *[batches, height, width, outputChannels]*
        The default value is *"nchw"*.

              - **"ihwo"**: *[inputChannels/groups, height, width, outputChannels]*
          The default value is *"oihw"*.

            is interpreted according to the value of *options*.{{MLConv2dOptions/inputLayout}}.
        - *filter*: an {{MLOperand}}. The filter 4-D tensor. The logical shape is
            interpreted according to the value of *options*.{{MLConv2dOptions/filterLayout}} and *options*.{{MLConv2dOptions/groups}}.
        - *options*: an {{MLConv2dOptions}}. The optional parameters of the operation.

    **Returns:** an {{MLOperand}}. The output 4-D tensor that contains the convolution result. The output shape is interpreted according to the *options*.{{MLConv2dOptions/inputLayout}} value. More specifically, the spatial dimensions or the sizes of the last two dimensions of the output tensor for the *nchw* input layout can be calculated as follow:

    *outputSize = 1 + (inputSize - (filterSize - 1) ** *dilation - 1 + beginningPadding + endingPadding) / stride*

### The matmul() method ### {#api-mlgraphbuilder-matmul}
Compute the matrix product of two input tensors.
<script type=idl>
partial interface MLGraphBuilder {
  MLOperand matmul(MLOperand a, MLOperand b);
};
</script>

<div>
    **Arguments:**
        - *a*: an {{MLOperand}}. The first N-dimensional input tensor.
        - *b*: an {{MLOperand}}. The second N-dimensional input tensor.

    **Returns:** an {{MLOperand}}. The output tensor that contains the matrix
    product of two input tensors.
</div>
<div>
    Computes the matrix product of two input tensors as follows:
        - If both *a* and *b* are 2-dimensional, they are multiplied like conventional
            matrices and produce a 2-dimensional tensor as the output.
        - If either *a* or *b* is `N`-dimensional where `N > 2`, it is treated as a stack of matrices with dimensions corresponding to the last two indices. The matrix multiplication will be broadcasted accordingly by following the [[!numpy-broadcasting-rule]]. The output is a `N`-dimensional tensor whose rank is the maximum [=rank=] of the input tensors. For each dimension, except the last two, of the output tensor, its size is the maximum size along that dimension of the input tensors.
        - If *a* is 1-dimensional, it is converted to a 2-dimensional tensor by prepending a 1 to its dimensions.
        - If *b* is 1-dimensional, it is converted to a 2-dimensional tensor by by appending a 1 to its dimensions.
        - If both *a* and *b* are 1-dimensional, the operation is a vector dot-product, which produces a scalar output.

    : <dfn>windowDimensions</dfn>

         A sequence of {{unsigned long}} of length 2: [windowHeight, windowWidth].
         Specifies the dimensions of the sliding window.
         The default value for the window dimensions are the height and width dimensions of the input shape.

    : <dfn>padding</dfn>
    ::
        A sequence of {{unsigned long}} of length 4: [beginningHeight, endingHeight, beginningWidth, endingWidth].
        Specifies the additional rows and columns added to the beginning and ending of each spatial dimension of the convolution input.
        The default value is [0,0,0,0].

    : <dfn>autoPad</dfn>
    ::
        An {{MLAutoPad}} [=string=].
        Specifies the automatic input padding options.
        The default value is *"explicit"*, which means that the values in the {{MLPool2dOptions/padding}} array should be used for input padding.
        When the option is set other than *"explicit"*, the values in the {{MLPool2dOptions/padding}} array are ignored.

        With the *"same-upper"* option, the padding values are automatically computed such that the additional ending padding of the spatial input dimensions would allow all of the input values in the corresponding dimension to be filtered.

        The *"same-lower"* option is similar but padding is applied to the beginning padding of the spatial input dimensions instead of the ending one.

    : <dfn>layout</dfn>
    ::
        An {{MLInputOperandLayout}} [=string=].
        Specifies the layout format of the input and output tensor as follows:
            - **"nchw"**
                - input tensor: *[batches, inputChannels, height, width]*

    : <dfn>roundingType</dfn>
    ::
        An {{MLRoundingType}} [=string=].
        Specifies the rounding function used to compute the output shape.

    : <dfn>outputSizes</dfn>
    ::
        A sequence of {{unsigned long}} of length 2.
        Specifies the sizes of the two spacial dimensions of the output tensor. When the output sizes are explicitly specified, the {{MLPool2dOptions/roundingType}} is ignored.

### Reduction operations ### {#api-mlgraphbuilder-reduce}
Reduce the input tensor along all dimensions, or along the axes specified in the {{MLReduceOptions/axes}}  array parameter. For each specified axis, the dimension with that index is reduced, i.e. the resulting tensor will not contain it, unless the {{MLReduceOptions/keepDimensions}} option is specified. The values of the resulting tensor are calculated using the specified reduction function that takes as parameters all the values across the reduced dimension.
<script type=idl>
dictionary MLReduceOptions {
  sequence<unsigned long> axes = null;
  boolean keepDimensions = false;
};

partial interface MLGraphBuilder {
  MLOperand reduceL1(MLOperand input, optional MLReduceOptions options = {});
  MLOperand reduceL2(MLOperand input, optional MLReduceOptions options = {});
  MLOperand reduceLogSum(MLOperand input, optional MLReduceOptions options = {});
  MLOperand reduceLogSumExp(MLOperand input, optional MLReduceOptions options = {});
  MLOperand reduceMax(MLOperand input, optional MLReduceOptions options = {});
  MLOperand reduceMean(MLOperand input, optional MLReduceOptions options = {});

  MLOperand reduceProduct(MLOperand input, optional MLReduceOptions options = {});
  MLOperand reduceSum(MLOperand input, optional MLReduceOptions options = {});
  MLOperand reduceSumSquare(MLOperand input, optional MLReduceOptions options = {});
};
</script>

<div>
    **Arguments:**
        - *input*: an {{MLOperand}}. The input tensor.
        - *options*: an optional {{MLReduceOptions}}. The optional parameters of the operation.
            - *axes*: a sequence of {{unsigned long}}. The dimensions to reduce. The values in the sequence must be in the range [0, N-1] where N is the [=rank=] of the input tensor.
                If not present, all dimensions are reduced.
            - *keepDimensions*: a {{boolean}}. If true, retains reduced dimensions with [=list/size=] 1.
                The default value is false.

    **Returns:** an {{MLOperand}}. The reduced output tensor.
</div>

### The transpose() method ### {#api-mlgraphbuilder-transpose}
Permute the dimensions of the input tensor according to the *permutation* argument.
<script type=idl>
dictionary MLTransposeOptions {
  sequence<unsigned long> permutation;
};

partial interface MLGraphBuilder {
  MLOperand transpose(MLOperand input, optional MLTransposeOptions options = {});
};
</script>

<div>
    **Arguments:**
        - *input*: an {{MLOperand}}. The input N-D tensor.
        - *options*: an optional {{MLTransposeOptions}}. The optional parameters of the operation.

    **Returns:** an {{MLOperand}}. The permuted or transposed N-D tensor.
</div>

{{MLTransposeOptions}} has the following members:
<dl dfn-type=dict-member dfn-for=MLTransposeOptions>
    : <dfn>permutation</dfn>
    ::
        A sequence of {{unsigned long}} values.
        Specifies the values used to permute the output shape.
        The default value is [N-1, ..., 0], where N is the [=rank=] of the input tensor, e.g. [2,1,0] for a 3-D tensor.
        These default values cause the output to become a transposed tensor of the input. When specified, the number of values in the sequence must be the same as the [=rank=] of the input tensor, and the values in the sequence must be within the range from 0 to N-1 with no two or more same values found in the sequence.
